            <li>I assigned each survivor its specific new variable. <br> The new variable described how many points from the initial religious value the survivor's religious belief decreased after the war. </li>
            <li>There will be two scenarios in my final paper. Each of them will be based on "True" and "Wrong" data sets.</li>
            <li>The main distinction I am going to make is that, by dropping a portion of the survivors whose interviews did not give any information about their current religion, we can conclude that the majority of survivors lost their faith after the war. </li>
            <li>Contrary, by keeping those survivors who did not explicitly mention anything about their religion, <br>we can also conclude that the change in religious beliefs after the war was not as statistically significant as it might seem. </li>
